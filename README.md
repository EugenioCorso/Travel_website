A mandatory project to pass the Distributed Programming I course of the Politecnico di Torino.

The request was to implement a distributed web applicazion using HTML and JavaScript for the user interface and PHP and MySQL for the backend.

I developed the application using HTML5, sticking with the MVC paradigm. For the style the CSS and Bootstrap framework have been used.
